This is the entirety of the SteamOS 3 source code.
These were willingly held onto by a select few of people, (AJ, etc) and kept in a very small circle. It was some kind of medium for them to jerk off about having "top-secret" shit
Some weird retarded guy managed to grab both these codebases during his work on some 2 millionth attempt of a SteamOS recreation project and his major goal was to have this circle, leak it to the public, and attempted to kill himself. Absolutely fucking insane, and it's something to have a chat over and laugh about it with your Linux friends
A lot of interesting knowledge can be gained from this codebases alone and a lot of resourceful information can come of it. Go wild!
